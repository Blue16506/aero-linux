## Current Status

### Live Environment Validation Passed

The live ISO has been built and verified on UEFI systems:

#### Boot & Desktop
* ISO builds successfully
* UEFI boot works (systemd-boot)
* Archiso root filesystem mounts correctly
* greetd + tuigreet launches with Aero branding
* Passwordless `liveuser` login works
* Hyprland launches with Waybar, Ghostty, Neovim, Zsh
* Desktop is fully usable from the live ISO

#### Fixes Applied
* OVMF_VARS: corrected source from OVMF_CODE to OVMF_VARS template
* KEYMAP detection: replaced broken pipe-to-read with command substitution
* snapper-boot.service: added `[Install]` section with `WantedBy=multi-user.target`
* Snapper config overlay: custom settings applied after `create-config`
* Walker: removed from ISO packages (AUR-only); added `walker-bin` to aur.packages
* Hyprland `pseudotile`: removed (option deleted upstream in 0.55)
* Hyprland `vfr`: moved from `misc` to `debug` section (upstream change in 0.55)
* Ghostty `gpu-accelerated`: removed (option no longer exists; GPU always-on)
* snapper-boot ExecStart: replaced shell operators with systemd `-ExecStart` prefix
* yay build errors: removed `2>/dev/null` masking from git clone and makepkg
* windowrules.conf: migrated all 14 rules from deprecated `windowrulev2` to modern `windowrule` syntax
* greetd launcher: switched from direct `Hyprland` to `start-hyprland` (uwsm wrapper)

## Roadmap

### Installer & Installed-System Validation (Current Priority)

* [ ] Full installation via `aero-install` in QEMU VM
* [ ] First successful installed-system boot
* [ ] First-boot automation (AUR packages, config deployment, snapper)
* [ ] Networking (NetworkManager)
* [ ] Audio (PipeWire)
* [ ] Snapper snapshots on installed system
* [ ] Theming on installed system
* [ ] Walker launcher install from AUR

### Known Remaining Issues

* BIOS bootloader installation broken (variable not expanded in quoted heredoc)
* NVIDIA GPU auto-detection pacman hook target incorrect
* BIOS live boot via syslinux untested
* `btop`/`lazygit` duplicated in packages

### Future Goals (Post-Validation)

* Hyprland Lua migration for remaining configs (if needed)
* BIOS bootloader fix
* NVIDIA pacman hook fix
* LUKS encryption support
* Plymouth boot splash
* Package selection during install
* Automated ISO releases
* Repository signing
* Theme system expansion

## Building the ISO

### Requirements

* Arch Linux host
* archiso
* limine

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blue16506/aero-linux.git
cd aero-linux

sudo ./build.sh
```

The generated ISO will be placed in:

```text
out/
```

---

## Installation

Boot the Aero Linux ISO and run:

```bash
aero-install
```

The installer will:

* Detect boot mode
* Configure disks
* Create Btrfs subvolumes
* Install the base system
* Configure users
* Install Limine
* Configure Snapper
* Enable required services

## Project Structure

Desktop configurations are modular:

```text
Hyprland
├── monitors.conf
├── input.conf
├── binds.conf
├── appearance.conf
├── autostart.conf
└── windowrules.conf
```

All desktop configurations live under:

```text
/usr/share/aero/configs/
```

and are deployed automatically during first boot.

---

## Development Status

Live environment validation is complete — no Hyprland deprecation warnings, clean `start-hyprland` launch. Development is now focused on:

* Full installation testing via `aero-install`
* Installed-system boot and first-boot validation
* Networking, audio, theming, snapper, and AUR package testing
* BIOS boot validation
* Beta preparation after full workflow validation
